# Discover Granada
## User Centric Frontend Development Milestone Project by Susana Viruglio

Discover Granada is a fictional tourist website that offers information about Granada: places to visit, book activities, places to eat, what to do and information. The idea of the decoration project came to me while I was actually visiting Granada on my holidays, I thought it could be a great idea to bring my personal experience to life. As I was visiting this city I was collecting ideas for the project from every place I was visiting.
My principal goal is interested in attracting and retaining tourists so they can book activities. 
Some potencial features to include are:
1. Photos ( views of places to go, places to visit,...).

2. Provide information on places to go (map) locations, opening hours, booking activities.

3. A map of Granada with information about how to get there, transport.

My first wireframe for desktop.

### Header
In my first page you will find the home page (header) where I described the purpose of this website with an introductory paragraph. I have added the principal header with a background picture. Beneath the principal image, I created the navigation menu with links of the three different web pages: what to do (information of places to go and what to eat) contact or about us (information about how to get there and a form if the user has any enquiry).
### Section 1
Underneath I will have my first section(h2) Welcome to Granada! with a paragraph description of the website and introduction attracting the user to know more about it.

### Section 2
In my section area I have provided the user with some interesting activities to book in Granada. I have used Bootstrap to create the layout and some pictures.

### Footer
Finally I have created the footer where some link in social media and email with a copyright.
