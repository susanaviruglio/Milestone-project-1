# Discover Granada
## User Centric Frontend Development Milestone Project by Susana Viruglio

Discover Granada is a fictional tourist website that offers information about Granada: places to visit, book activities, places to eat, what to do and information. The idea of the project decoration came to me while I was actually visiting Granada on my holidays, I thought it could be a great idea to make my personal experience to life. As I was visiting this city I was collecting ideas for the project from every place I was visiting.
My principal goal is interested in attracting and retaining tourists so they can book activities. 
Some potencial features to include are:
1. Photos ( views of places to go, places to visit,...).

2. Provide information on places to go (map) locations, opening hours, book activities.

3.Map of Granada which information about how to get there, tranporst.

# USER STORIES

1. 









# Home

page
Firstly in my first page you will find the home page (header) where I will describe the purpose of this website. I will add the principal header with a background picture. 
Then I will add the menu buttons with the links of the different website pages: what to do (information of places to go and what to eat) contact or about us (information about how to get there and a form if the user has any enquire).
Underneath I will have my first section(h2) Welcome to Granada! with a paragraph description of the website and introduction.

(I have not decided yet this part)In my second section I will add a desmy next h2 named History & Culture where I will offer the reader a summary about the history of Granada. The reader will have the option of reading and learning so they will get information to get later on the discount.
In my last division I will add a small section with picture of my menu so the reader do not need to go back up and find the links to the next pages. In this way I consider it will attract the attention of the user and finally visit the other sites.
Lastly the user will find a footer section with social links and some links with my contact, or more information.
