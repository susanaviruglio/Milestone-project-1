# milestone1
Welcome!
This is Susana Viruglio's first Milestone project which it is based on a turistic website. The site's user goal are tourists who wish to visit Granada and they wish to know what to do , which activities they can book, places to eat.
My principal goal is interested in attracting and retaining tourists so they can book activities or visit other links provided.
Some potencial features to include are:
1. Photos ( views of places to go, places to visit,...).

2. Provide information on places to go (map) locations, opening hours, book activities.

3.Map of Granada which information about how to get there, tranporst.

Firstly in my first page you will find the home page (header) where I will describe the purpose of this website. I will add the principal header with a background picture. 
Then I will add the menu buttons with the links of the different website pages: what to do, activities, information and contact or about us.
Underneath I will have my second header (h2) Welcome to Granada! with a paragraph description of the website.
Then, I had the idea to attract the reader or viewer by offering a special discount, the user would need to read the information about a quiz and it will have a link direct to the quiz site.
In my next division I will add my next h2 named History & Culture where I will offer the reader a summary about the history of Granada. The reader will have the option of reading and learning so they will get information to get later on the discount.
In my last division I will add a small section with picture of my menu so the reader do not need to go back up and find the links to the next pages. In this way I consider it will attract the attention of the user and finally visit the other sites.
Lastly the user will find a footer section with social links and some links with my contact, or more information.
